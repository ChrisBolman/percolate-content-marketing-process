# Percolate's Content Marketing Process (M-WIP 2.0)
This documentation lays out Percolate's core content marketing workflow. This is the process the marketing department follows to move work from concept through execution, and can be used as a reference for campaign management, business process design, or a content marketing / brand editorial approach. This system is designed for an integrated team of 10-20 members, including creative services, but can be adapted and scaled up or down to fit the needs of your business. While it's not perfect, we've found it to be a smart, consistent, and efficient way to work, and continue to look for opportunities to improve and optimize it. While it helps if you implement this process alongside your use of [Percolate] (https://percolate.com), our hope is this document serves as a helpful reference and thought-starter for both customers and non-customers.
# Team Responsibilities / Accountability Matrix
Clear roles, responsibilities, and decision-makers minimize decision points and help work get done faster. We start by documenting each step (phase) of our content marketing or campaign process, as well as who's involved at each step, and what we expect from them.
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisBolman/percolate-content-marketing-process/master/images/percolate-wip-marketing-responsibility-matrix-v1.png)
As you can see there are nine steps for each campaign, project, or piece of content. Each step does not need to be observed and followed to the tee, but each step should at least be considered, like a checklist. Before moving to the next step, whoever's resposible for the project (or for moving it from its current step the next step) must make sure they've satisfied the requirements at that step (or that the requirements or the step itself doesn't apply in this particular case). 
## Step 1 - Brief

Owner: Marketer (i.e., the associate, manager, or team lead who's responsible for the business outcome or objective)

Responsibility: The marketer owns the brief development and makes sure that all stakeholder objectives are represented. 

Brief template structure:

#####Challenge
What is the business or creative problem we’re trying to solve? Why does it matter?

#####Target Audience
Who are we trying to influence? What do we want them to feel? Like to any audience research, interviews, and/or profiles when applicable. 
#####Message / Experience
What is the most important thing we're looking to communicate? How does this message tie back to the overall story or narrative we're looking to further? How does it relate to a product, brand, and/or consumer truth?

#####Call to Action 
What action do we want recipients of the messsage to take?

#####Project Owner 
Who owns the project and is responsible for approving the final brief, blessing the vision, making sure the project is a success, and taking accountability for the outcome?

#####Brief Approver(s)
Who needs to approve this brief or a specific step of the work before we can move on to the next step?

#####Project Lead
Who will lead the proposal and development of this project? Who will project manage it and ensure that the workspace is organized, resources are effectively managed, timelines are adhered to, and updates / results are properly communicated to stakeholders?

#####Project Team
Who's working on the project? At times the Project Team is not defined until the scope is in place, and that's totally fine.

#####Stakeholders
Who are the stakeholders who need to be kept updated on the work? These people might not be directly involved in the project, but will be kept up to date on important milestones. 

#####Due Date / Deadline
By when does this project neeed to be completed? What are different flights or phases?

## Step 2 - Proposal

The proposal outlines the solution recommended by the project team. 

Upfront the Marketer and Project Lead agree how much time is needed for the proposal stage.

Large projects up to 5 days / 40hrs

Proposal template structure:

Solution

Call to action
Outline how are we going to drive people to take the desired action.
