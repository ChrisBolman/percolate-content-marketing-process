# Percolate's Content Marketing Process (M-WIP 2.0)
This documentation lays out Percolate's core content marketing workflow. This is the process the marketing department follows to move work from concept through execution, and can be used as a reference for campaign management, business process design, or a content marketing / brand editorial approach. This system is designed for an integrated team of roughly 15 members, including creative services, but can be adapted and scaled up or down to fit the needs of your business. While it's not perfect, we've found it to be a smart, consistent, and efficient way to work, and continue to look for opportunities to improve and optimize it. While it helps if you implement this process alongside your use of [Percolate] (https://percolate.com), our hope is this document serves as a helpful reference and thought-starter for both customers and non-customers.
# Team Responsibilities / Accountability Matrix
Clear roles, responsibilities, and decision-makers minimize decision points and help work get done faster. We start by documenting each step (phase) of our content marketing or campaign process, as well as who's involved at each step, and what we expect from them.

As you can see there are nine steps for each campaign, project, or piece of content. Each step does not need to be observed and followed to the tee, but each step should at least be considered, like a checklist. Before moving to the next step, whoever's resposible for the project (or for moving it from its current step the next step) must make sure they've satisfied the requirements at that step (or that the requirements or the step itself doesn't apply in this particular case). 
## Step 1 - Brief
